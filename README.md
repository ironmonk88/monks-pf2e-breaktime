# Monk's PF2E Encounter Aftermath
Add-On Module for Foundry VTT
Ever ask your players after a combat 'What are you doing now' and then have to awkwardly figure out what's happening every 10 minutes, while everyone is talking over each other. Yeah, that's no fun.

This module is intended to bridge the gap between encounters and exploration. Your party is no longer in combat rounds, but still needs to measure the general time spent on tasks. Tasks that needs to happen before the party is allowed to roam freely with exploration tasks.

## Installation
Simply use the install module screen within the FoundryVTT setup

## Usage & Current Features
On the Party sheet a new tab will be added called "Activities".

You can drag and drop Macros, Actions, Items and Feats to the party members and then set how long that action will take to do.

The GM can then click the Advance Time button to advance game time until those actions are ready to be completed. And either the player or GM will then have access to a button to run those actions.

If your character is choosing to do nothing for a period of time, right click the party member and select "Do Nothing" to have that action added.

Statistics are also kept for the total time it's taken to complete all actions, how many actions remain, and how much time remains to be taken.
